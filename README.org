ipv6day -- Get The Results Yourself

* Objective

  The ipv6day script is a very simple perl program that tests sites for
  DNS entries for IPv6 data.  Most importantly, it doesn't just check
  for an AAAA record for the web server.  That's not enough to be
  considered truly IPv6 enabled.  At a minimum, the DNS servers for a
  given domain must be accessible over IPv6 as well.  Since EMail is
  still a fairly popular transport thees days, the script also checks
  for a valid IPv6 MX record.

* Usage

  # ./ipv6day [SITES] > results.html
  # favorite-browser rseults.html

  A list of sites that indicated they would participate in the 2011
  World IPv6 Day can be found in "2011-sites.txt" so that this is
  possible:

  # ./ipv6day `cat 2011-sites.txt` > results.html


* Future work

  Any simple program should be subject to feature creep...

  + Maybe make it perform a service availability test too.
